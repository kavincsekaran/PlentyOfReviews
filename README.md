<b>Summary</b>

The purpose of this project was to analyze listings for airbnb's in Boston for the purposes of extracting a diverse and representative set of reviews in cases where there were a large numbers of reviews(>=100). Raw data used for this analysis had previously been scrapped as part of a project which can be found at the last link of the other resources above.


<b>How to Reproduce the Work</b>

Execute the 'Reviews_Analysis.ipynb'. Updates required include changing just paths where csv files are read and manage the path to where you want to store the output csv. This file produces the "listing_topics.txt" file provided in the github repo. This file populates the webpage.
