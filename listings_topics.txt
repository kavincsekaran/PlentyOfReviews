4460532|Jonathan's place is a gem. He ensured my stay was comfortable and enjoyable. The room was immaculate. He even provided a map of the neighborhood with some interesting points of historical interest, as well as personal recommendations for food and drink. There are other guests staying there as well, but Jonathan makes sure each guest has their own space to accommodate their needs. Very close to the Orange T subway line, getting into the city was a breeze. I would absolutely stay at Jonathan's again.|Very comfortable and clean room, Jonathan was great, very friendly and the location was very good.|Great, clean, quiet|Great place to stay.

11866651|Great place, John was an excellent host. |Second stay at this place and loved it even more the second time! Has everything we needed and the neighborhood is great!|This is a lovely house on a charming street that feels wonderfully quaint while also being exceptionally convenient. It is clean, well-kept, elegantly decorated. The host offered thoughtful touches of hospitality and was also very attentive to our needs. Highly recommended! |Great house and location!|The house is a fabulous stay.  It's well equipped and stocked with everything you would expect to need.  It's been nicely modernized with unique and clever touches.  The house is cozy and warm.  Just note that it is indeed a New England town home, so the spiraling staircase between floors can be challenging for some older guests.  But other than that, John thought of just about everything.  Plenty of towels, blankets, etc .... all the amenities you would expect from a super host.  The bottle of wine and bagels were a nice touch and my son was really glad about the fresh bottle of OJ in the fridge.  It's in walking distance to wonderful eating spots and has a energetic nightlife if you are into that type of thing.

8302844|My husband and I stayed at Jj's place for a bit over a month. We love Beacon Hill and were very familiar with the area after spending the previous month in a different accommodation.   The apartment was as described in many ways; cozy, subterranean and charming all make sense but read the description with a grain of salt. As other guests have mentioned, the space is dark. Some more lighting might be helpful in completing daily tasks like putting on make-up, shaving, washing dishes, etc. The photos accurately depict the furnishings and give a general feel for the space. There is a small chaise lounge but we found ourselves sitting on the (uncomfortable) bed almost all of the time. The kitchen was nearly non-functional. The bathroom is in serious need of some TLC with a TINY shower and giant crack in the floor tile.  The best part about the apartment is the location; convenient to Whole Foods, convenience stores, bars, liquor stores, coffee shops, gyms, sights, subway, etc. Although the location is prime, it did not justify the price tag.   This might be an OK spot for a solo traveler to rest their head for a couple of nights. It will give you the quintessential Beacon Hill feel but if you are looking for a quality experience -  I would suggest looking elsewhere. |Great apartment in an excellent location. Jj was a brilliant, communicative host and gave clear instructions on how to access the property. Perfect base to explore Boston from!|Apartment was excellent, Jj's instructions were clear and everything was clran ready when we arrived. Great location for discovering Boston!|Appartement idalement situ.  Jj est  l'coute. Il a remplac le matelas pneumatique dfectueux immdiatement.|Location was great! We walked everywhere and took the T every day. T stop was 5 minutes away. Food and drink are very expensive in this location so it was nice to be able to cook most meals. Jj has a stove and the basics for cooking. I would recommend bringing coffee and about over plastic coffee thing since all he has Isa small percolator. I was also glad I brought my own towels and sheets. The place is dim but I found doing my makeup in the hallway was bright enough. |Historic servant's quarters in Beacon Hill|Downtown|Entire home/apt|https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/107456072/0c51c155_original.jpg?aki_policy=large|https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/8302844

8065282|Staying here was very nice. Jordan was very helpful in setting me up when I first arrived. The neighborhood is also very conveniently located.|The property is the ground floor of a town house on Chelsea street. It's exactly 3 minutes away from the T station, and a 7 minute drive to the airport. The neighborhood is safe and quiet. Amazingly accessible to all things Boston, and great value for money. Jordan is a great host who sometimes goes out of his way to accommodate, and tries to find solutions to any problem that comes up to make our stay more comfortable. We have really felt it to be our home during our 15-day stay.|Great location, close proximity to the T station and airport. The apartment's interior was a bit dated but very spacious, especially the living area. The host provided lots of handy local information and was quick to respond to my enquiries.

Also the bed was too comfortable let me almost miss the check out time. Sicerely recommend the nice host and his apartment.|Great location and just quick light rail rides from the downtown and historical districts! We weren't entirely aware it was a shared Airbnb location, so you have to be prepared that you're sharing common spaces like the bathroom and kitchen with other folks. It's pretty minimal for amenities. We didn't meet the hosts and only saw the other Airbnb people for twenty seconds.   The greatest thing about this experience was how kind Yu-Chen was about getting us into the space with travel plans that would have left us with nowhere to go for many cold hours with all our luggage. We are so appreciative for his flexibility! |Very happy with my stay here. The accommodation was as described and the host was very helpful.|Het was een geweldige ervaring. Het huis was stil, schoon, het bed sliep heerlijk en de metro stopte voor de deur. Ook was er op 3 minuten lopen een supermarkt aanwezig die 24 uur per dag open is! Yu-Chen had leuke aanbevelingen over de buurt en reageerde vrijwel direct op onze vragen via de chat. De buurt leeft en voelt zeer veilig.

2441095|It was a great stay at Shawns apartment! It was clean and comfortable and it's close to the city Center. A good spot to start your sightseeing tour!|Great place for the price. Lots of stuff within walking distance and 5-10 min walk to the subway. |It was okay. The perk of living in Shawn's is the location. But otherwise it was okay. |Nice flat, nice and clean, short walk to the train into town.|The listing has been reported to the Boston Fire Prevention dept., there was a smoke detector that had been removed between the bedrooms, and several other empty brackets in the apartment, they are out of compliance according to who we spoke to.  We had no problem with the neighborhood, but wouldn't recommend the apartment to anyone with health issues getting around as the staircase is steep and narrow.  With the sloped floors in the bedroom, placing anything on the desk could mean you could lose it, ex. earrings.  The missing towel bar in the bathroom meant that all towels were hung in the bedroom closet, making the closet area less useful.  With air conditioning in only the living area, and 1 bedroom, means that someone will not be comfortable at night.  The scratched teflon on the pans made them something I didn't want to use, as well as the filth on the kitchen floor upon check-in, and the cabinet that was filled with bags that were stuck to it?!  The beds were not great, reminded me of my grandmother's antique from 30+ years ago, but I guess that's better than a bed that's rock hard.  Although Shawn was decent about getting back to us with a few things, we lost about an hour the first day just cleaning the apartment and washing the floor to make it palatable for our stay.  When you pre-pay for your vacation and visit, it doesn't make it easy to just walk away, so we made the best of it.|Economical 2 Bedroom Condo Near Subway (88B)|East Boston|Entire home/apt|https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/34271804/01695654_original.jpg?aki_policy=large|https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/2441095

815639|Excellent location, great bed, good shower. Close to cannoli, 24 hours a day!|Great location. The apartment is OK. |We only stayed overnight, but the apt was just as shown in website. It was very walkable to what we were doing in Boston. |The location of the space couldn't be better but the comfort negatively impacted our stay.  The main issues were the noise and the bed.    Although the listing notes the importance of being quiet and using inside voices, even inside voices can be heard from the people upstairs as well as *every* step that's made.  It's an old space, which is charming, but the noise level makes it very hard to rest or sleep -- we heard intimate moments from above, and then a new group came and we heard an infant crying all through the night. Neither of these were parties -- so complaints to Jose would not have been appropriate -- but they certainly were still heard!  It's actually like being in the room with your upstairs neighbor, although you also hear every creaky footstep.    The other main issue was the mattress in that there's a dip in its center that makes it impossible to even lay flat. It's clearly overused and ready to be replaced.  These two issues combined resulted in little sleep and also no place to rest, which unfortunately had a negative impact on our ability to fully enjoy the Boston visit.    As far as furnishings, there are no period pieces as noted in the listing and the loveseat is so uncomfortable it's hard to sit on.    Jose's nice and responsive, but be forewarned about these issues with the space.  I was disappointed that few prior reviewers noted such concerns, so I'm being honest here.|Great location and stay for our trip to Boston. |Sophisticated Saucy Studio  Easy T Access!|North End|Entire home/apt|https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/65132841/e012f427_original.jpg?aki_policy=large|https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/815639

The apt building is very modern and the concierge team were very helpfull and providing and amazing service. I recommend this place for anyone coming on short or long term since its location allows you to move around very easily and to feel just at home on the time you spend on the apartment.|Good apartment, liked to location. Place needs a little bit of upkeep. |The apartment was great, with easy access to center of Boston and South Station and convenient shopping at Whole Foods,  which is directly opposite the apartment. It's in great condition overall, it was just disappointing that the kitchen drawers and cupboards were dirty, two of the pans were covered in rust,  and there were only a few glasses.  These things stood out mainly because the rest of the apartment was in immaculate condition.  Josh was pleasant to deal with and got the WiFi and cable (which weren't working when we arrived) fixed quickly. Overall, if Josh can deal with the kitchen issues, I'd recommend it without hesitation. |Lux City Pad 22 with huge terrace!|South End|Entire home/apt|https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/abf50bfa-639e-4fb9-b46d-0c55fc458448.jpg?aki_policy=large|https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/8988506

23619|,,,,,,!Henry And Lisa Chen,!|I stayed here with my 12 year old.  We were out a lot, so mainly used apartment for sleeping which was perfect since it's a studio.   There are two windows which make it seem more spacious, but no view.  This wasn't an issue for us bc their is a wonderful space to sit out on the rooftop and enjoy a snack as well as awesome city views.   The location was fantastic...very close to the everything and  convenient store and restaurants next to apartment.   The building was well maintained and safe.   I think the space would be ideal for a single person as well.   |Henry og Lisa var de perfekte vrter! Mine forldre lejede lejligheden (da jeg selv er bosat i Boston) og de var ovenud tilfredse. Lejligheden ligger centralt, lige over for Boston Common og tt p flere T-stop. Faktisk ligger lejligheden i gafstand til de fleste sevrdigheder, s mine forldre fik slet ikke brug for deres metrokort. Lejligheden er ren og rummelig og passer perfekt til et par. Der er ogs adgang til en skn tagterrasse. Henry og Lisa er utroligt venlige og meget fleksible nr det kommer til check in og check ud. Vi vil helst sikkert anbefale lejligheden til kommende gster!|Had a great time staying at Henry and Lisa's airbnb.

Very private and comfortable.  |Overall our stay was pleasant. It was a lovely place and pretty cozy as a basement apt.  We were thankful that they respected our privacy and made our stay comfortable with provided coffee and towels and toiletries (although some of the shampoocontainer bottles were nearly empty and we had to use a combo of a few btwn the both of us). Having the list of places that are 5 mins walking distance was also great (we really enjoyed Devlin's!)  A few things to keep in mind though. I drive a big sized SUV and parking was pretty terrible. Three cars are supposed to be sharing the space but I literally had to jam my car into the last spot available, parking diagonally on the grass. The next morning, there was another car parked behind the second car making it even more difficult to back out. Nearly impossible even with my bf helping me back out. I wished I had known that the parking space was really tight..anything bigger than an SUV will not fit. Also, there are no windows, so no natural light. Make sure to set several alarms to help wake up. Also phone reception was really bad bc it was the basement, although Wi-Fi worked great. The apt was absolutely freezing when we walked in and we could not change it. Thankfully there were throw blanket that we used around the apt. Lastly, there is no room in the bathroom to place any of our stuff, even it was a really inviting bathroom. Just no countervanity space. Had to move around a lot of stuff to make some room. Same with the bedroom, it would of been nice to maybe have a dessert next to the bed? I pulled in the desk chair to use  as a night stand. The bed was also not very comfortable personally.  But it was a pleasant and homey stay. It definitely served its purpose as for 2 night stay in Boston.|I enjoyed my stay at Deepti and Michael's downstairs-apartment. It was clean and quiet and had everything I needed. The space is so big it would be perfect for a couple.

Joe's place was super clean and the building and the street was very quiet.  During the Head of the Charles weekend when discount hotel rooms were 200+, this was a great deal.

Location couldn't have been more central to EVERYTHING, walking distance to all sights, making it extremely convenient for sightseeing in Boston. Also, just steps from the metro, which gets you to Harvard Yard in no time. Check-in was a breeze and Jason was very helpful. The property itself was immaculate and gorgeous. It really gives you that Boston brownstone feel and the furnishing was top notch. Beds were large and comfy, sheets and pillows clean and cozy. Kitchen was setup for entertaining and well stocked. Spent lots of time relaxing in the Living space after long days of sightseeing, as it was well setup with plenty of comfy seating. Internet worked great and allowed us to keep up with our business.

Margaret was lovely and very accommodating .|My daughter and I enjoyed a fantastic two night stay at Margaret's lovely home. Margaret is a warm and welcoming host. She was very helpful with recommendations of things to see and do in both her neighborhood and Boston. When we arrived, we safely parked our car at her house and did not use it again until we left. Her house is located in a convenient, quiet, walkable neighborhood. We could easily walk to the T in less than ten minutes. From there it took only about 20 minutes to get into downtown Boston. We were also able to walk to a nearby street with several hip and fun coffee shops, restaurants and retail stores. I highly recommend her home and look forward to returning on my next trip to Boston. |This is our second time with Margaret, and she provides such a welcoming and comfortable space.   Access to the T is easy - just a 10 min. walk which is nothing in Boston area.   Highly recommend but just hope someone else doesn't book her before we get a chance to our next trip to the area!   :-)  |Great option and a very pleasant stay. Margaret is lovely and kind.

3749523|Context: 3 adults and 1-year old child (2 other adults cancelled at last minute) Location  was excellent. 15 minute walk to heart of Boston; 10 mins to Subway station; Wholefoods and bakery on your doorstep.  Roku box came in handy on quieter evenings. Nicolo was very responsive when we had questions.  Value for money was questionable based on issues found: 1. Floors were in need of a wash. Not noticeable for adults but with a crawling infant it quickly became clear from the blacks marks on clothes.  2. Oven was dirty - looked like it had been cleaned poorly in the past.  3. There were no air-conditioning units downstairs. Heat from the kitchen meant it was uncomfortable at times. Floor-level fan was available however we were unwilling to use it due to having a crawling infant. |This is a beautiful home. Communication with Nicolo was great, quick to respond to any questions. We also had access to the housekeeper, Dorothy who we had the pleasure to meet one day, what a lovely lady.  She was also quick to answer any questions we had and offered suggestions for local places to eat. Access to the house is keyless, very easy and very secure. Traveling with 3 teens, 19, 17 and 14, this house had all the space we needed! The beds were very comfortable, linens were clean, plenty of extra towels, 3 bathrooms was a bonus! Washing machine and dryer in the basement, ice maker in the freezer, TV's in the bedrooms. The kitchen is big and has everything you need if you chose to cook in. We loved the outdoor setting on the front porch, for morning coffee and breakfast and then again in the evenings to relax after long days out. The location is fantastic! We parked the car and did not use it again until it was time to leave - 5 days later! The orange T is about a 7 minute walk, if you time it right you can be downtown in 20 minutes or less. Public transportation is easy, we never waited more than 6 minutes for a train. We walked a lot, Freedom Trail etc, and really enjoyed just walking around the neighborhood seeing all the old houses. We ate out at a few places near the house and the North End is a short walk which has many, many dining options. We would absolutely stay with Nicolo again.

I couldn't recommend them enough! |Erika and Liam's hospitality made our stay in Boston so much more enjoyable. They were great at communicating, the moment I booked their room they welcomed me. They were available to welcome us in person during check in. They provided all the essentials like snacks, water, coffee, chocolates, all the toiletries you can think of, and even included iteneraries and recommendations. They were super accommodating, providing us umbrellas on rainy days and letting us come back in after check out to use the bathroom and grab snacks before we left. Their previous guests left their 7-day passes and Erika let us use them, so we got free transportation! Walkable distance from the T. Quiet neighborhood, super friendly people, clean and well decorated room, great experience! Grateful to have found such a great Airbnb!|Nice place to stay for a quick weekend in Boston.|Convenient.

But the room was nice. We haven't seen Steve. |Reading the previous reviews - all are very accurate. The check inout process with Steve was very simple and easy. The room we stayed in was big, clean, and comfy. The location of the airbnb is yes, a little rough, and you would not want to wander around late at night. For the most part it felt safe during the day. Additionally, I'd say that other guests were a little bit disruptive at 3am and I believe tried to shh them. I think that perhaps in the future if there was an issue with other guests to go directly to them to quiet them down. (Again, this was more of an issue with other guests). Other than that the location was about 15 minutes driving from downtown and to the airport. Decent price for the location and very comfortable room. Thanks for your accommodations, Steve! |Steve was an incredibly friendly and gracious host, offering lots of tips about Boston and places nearby to visit.

15548410|Grace is a fantastic host!  The space was immaculate and quiet.  My only problem was parking.  There is very little parking available, free or otherwise.  I drove up and down the one street with free parking for quite some time hoping to find something but never did.  I then went to the one public parking lot close enough to their place only to find out that I would have to walk back down to the lot at 5am the next morning to pay 25 for the day on top of the night time parking fee around 10, or risk getting towed.  I pulled into the lot around 9pm so this was not acceptable to me.  It was stressful after a long travel day and difficulty finding a parking spot. But Grace totally saved me!  She and Will allowed me to use their garage to park in.  I was extremely grateful and relieved.  |Great place to stay!|Had such a great stay! Everything was so close. The room matched exactly what the pictures show!! Will and Grace were very helpful and even gave us a list of place to eat near by. Definitely want to come back! |We had a great experience at Will and Grace's. They weren't home to greet us, but they have a keypad entry so we were able to get in and drop stuff off though they weren't there. The room was just as pictured - it's got a mini fridge, microwave and coffee maker if needed, and the attached bath is awesome - small but the shower is roomy for the size and has great water pressuretemperature. We booked for its proximity to Fenway Park and it was an easy 1 mile walk there from the home. There was an inexpensive parking lot a couple of blocks away where we left our cars overnight. I would definitely book this room the next time I stay in Boston!|Very convenient place.|Private Full Bath, Spotless Room, Amazing Location|Mission Hill|Private room|https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/d1054a89-9dd2-4645-9635-bbff357dfc61.jpg?aki_policy=large|https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15548410

Lais is really nice to provide useful guidance. She can offer a list of places worth a visit. If you plan to stay in Bos longer than 3 days, it's a good idea to purchase a charlie's card with unlimited rides within a week. That's also what Lais said.

1112193|It was very close to downtown Boston.  The room was clean with fresh sheets and towels.  He was available by phone.  We had to make a change at the last minute and he was very kind to refund us some money.  The steps were very steep to the upstairs.  We were fine with that, but it is information someone might need to know.  Thank you for being so understanding.  |Steve is a very warm and welcoming host. The house is nice and very clean. The room was large, and the bed was very comfortable. They even have a TV with cable in the room, which was good for having some downtime after walking all day.  We met a range of people at the house, from all different countries- which was very neat! There is also a drive way if you drive up or rent a car.  The house is about a 7 minute walk from the train, which was very convenient. The neighborhood was ok, not a lot of food or stores nearby that I saw. I felt much safer at night, since I was traveling with my boyfriend. However, as a woman, I would not come back to this neighborhood alone, or with another girlfriend. The neighborhood seems to be in a state of repair, where there is a lot of renovation going on, which is great for the area! I don't want to discourage anyone from staying here, but I would exercise caution if you don't feel secure by yourself in a neighborhood in a state of transition.|Perfect location to go anywhere :) Host is super duper awesome.

1884045|     Sarah        , Sarah        .    .|Sarah's place was really clean and nice. She greeted us promptly and her house looked to be a renewed historic house. Pretty nice!  The rooms look just like the pictures. The tips I might leave is that the room is on the 3rd floor and has 1 bathroom to share with whoever is renting the room across the hall. This got a little frustrating since it seemed like all parties wanted to use the bathroom at the same time!  We also ran out of toilet paper our last night, couldn't find any stock, and wasn't able to get a hold of Sarah until after we left, which was also a little frustrating. She did take care of the toilet paper situation early this morning, but our flight happened to be a really early 6:15 am flight.  Another thing to note is that the wifi is a mifi device, but Sarah said it was a temporary solution since she just moved to this location.  The last tip is that when we returned from being out all day, the day got to a cool 60 degrees, but our room on the 3rd floor was probably 85...It was toasty! We even kept the window open all day while we were out and it was still hot! It did eventually cool down with the fan on high and the door open, but took a couple hours.  Aside from those things, the place was really nice and the evenings were quiet, even with the window open. Sarah was very friendly and prompt with responses. Lovely place with amazing wood stairs and floors... very nice touch!|Sarah was very welcoming, and the room was clean and comfortable.|The location is in a good place. Sarah was easy to get a hold of and very friendly. The onsite parking made it a good deal.  The bedroom and bathroom are on the 3rd floor away from everyone else so there's some privacy. However, the bathroom was filthy, there were mouse droppings in the room, and we had some challenges with the logistics of entering and exiting the home, because of poor instructions. I wouldn't stay here again.  |Sarah is a very kind person.

Highly recommend his place. Clean, great view, great location, overall awesome place. |Bernie was very easy to get in touch with and very flexible with check-in, and made the process very easy. The room itself was cozy and very comfortable with a lot of extra amenities (i.e. extra blankets, lint roller, sightseeing information, to name a few). The bathroom was clean and well-maintained, with extra shampoo and soap in case you forgot yours. The location was also amazing--it's literally inside the Longwood Galleria and just a block away from BIDMC, BWH, and Dana Farber, and a quick 10 minute walk to the D line. Really enjoyed my stay and would highly recommend!|This was exactly what I was looking for.

14483758|Great|Despite a good location the property was not maintained to acceptable standards, TV not working, no amenities whatsoever such as coffee water sugar milk etc Safety issues CO Detector with no batteries, front door frame damaged. In summary nowhere near the expected standard - our worst ever AirBB experience.|This was my first airbnb ever, and I was very pleased with it. The location is excellent - in Boston's Little Italy - cute, narrow streets, walking distance to lots of nice restaurants, and one of the wharfsdowntown.   I would definitely stay here again. Clean. Laundry (towels, bedsheets, etc) was totally cleansmelled nice as well. One of the blinds was broken upon getting in and almost hit one of us but luckily it didn't hit her. Hopefully that gets fixed.   There is a parking structure close by that ended up pretty pricey but given that you're in downtown Boston, not sure this could be avoided.   All in all, I'm very happy that this was my first airbnb impression, and honestly, I'm hoping that too many people don't find out about this place, because in my fantasy world, this WOULD be my 2nd home.|Great stay!|The place is in a great location but the building has neighbors that will effect your sleep.  It has steep stairs that could use some cleaning and the neighbor smoke p! ...Matt is hoping to get rid of them, but there is thumping music.    Honestly a hotel would have been more comfortable.

12233225|Our stay was good and mostly comfortable. We were able to check out late, which is great. Ricardo was really nice. The kitchen area is well-equipped. The location is really good. But the construction noise (6am-8am) and thin walls were a problem for us, so we could not sleep well. This place is more of a 'private room' than an 'entire home.' |Comfy bed, had everything we needed. No frills and good location. Would recommend on a budget.|A few minutes away from public transport. Close to airport shuttle which was important as I had a 6am flight to catch.  Right near city waterfront view.  Spacious room and comfortable bed.|This hotel is just as described. It is more of a private room but it is what I expected for the price as long as you realize that you will be fine. Ricardo was very nice and there to answer any questions I had. The walls are very thin. The person staying next door woke me up from snoring every night I was there. Although it wasn't the best it was what I could afford in Boston and you get what you pay for. |   | AIRBNB HOTEL 6|East Boston|Private room|https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/12b6f5eb-c028-4bd9-977b-93063f6ccc94.jpg?aki_policy=large|https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12233225
4555637|Jonathan is a great host! I enjoy the stay there for the MRS conference at Boston. The housemates are nice and friendly. The decoration and the style of the house is contemporary and stylish which is exactly what I love for my own apartment. Jonathan is very considerate and prepared me a glass water bottle and maps for all different restaurants and places to go nearby the house. He also answered my question about parking very specifically. I will definitely visit again in the future if I get a chance.|Great stay in large very clean room! Would definetly stay again!|This is a great space to stay for the price that you're paying! Its very close to the subway, and better still it is very inexpensive to get to downtown and other areas using Uberpool. I routinely was able to get to the Convention center for my conference for between 3-5 per trip. The place is beautiful and clean. Its located in the attic with very charming decor. The only caveat is that you don't have solid walls that keep out noise from the main house- just curtains. You can't change the schedules of other folks in the house so if you're a light sleeper bring earplugs! |Jonathan has restored his brownstone building so fresh and clean it reminds me of Brooklyn|I'm a pretty basic guy, give me a pillow and I'm happy.

Very clean and quiet.|This place was perfect for us newcomers to Boston. We needed something  convenient and close to the downtown area. We were on the top floor with a shared living room, kitchen, and bathroom space, with our own private bedroom. Towels and toiletries were provided for in case people forgot to bring thecirr own. The rooms were great! Very clean and comfortable. The open windows and fans were sufficient enough to keep us cool during the day and night  in the heat of Boston. There was reserved parking for us on the side of the building where we left our car for the day and used the subway that was less than a 5th minute walk heading towards Downtown Boston. Last but not least, Ricardo was a pleasant host who offered us very useful suggestion on where to go and how to get there. He gave us a handful of brochures for public transit maps. The entire stay, though short, was perfect. Thanks for being a great host Ricardo! |Trs bon sjour  Boston. Appartement agrable et bien plac.|Really nice stay in Boston. With the metro you are only some minutes away from downtown. The room is in a nice neighbourhood with a great view on the skyline of boston just 5 min away.

11983286|Davis and Rachael were very hospitable hosts. The room we stayed in was very clean, comfortable, and cozy. We brought our dog, Philip, along with us on our weekend trip and the hosts gladly accommodated us. Rachael was even kind enough to watch Philip and keep him company while we were out and about roaming the streets of Boston!  Overall, I have all but complaints about these wonderful hosts. They even provided us with literature and tips on where to go and things to do in the area. Highly recommended!|Davis ,, ,, !|This has been my best Airbnb experience yet!

Davis went above and beyond by letting me use their ironing board and iron when I discovered that my shirt for an interview had become wrinkled on my way to Boston.

Highly recommend water taxi to airport, it's a short 10 minute walk. |Nice place in a great location|Great stay|Fantastic location!|Very, nice clean apartment. It was nice to have the kitchen for cooking breakfast before before heading out for the day. The second bed was in the living room, so some what noisy with people and cars going by. This neighborhood stays out late and gets up early. If you are a light sleeper take the bedroom and keep the door shut. Both beds are comfortable with nice cozy comforters.  We did not get to meet James, but did speak with him on the phone. He was friendly and helpful. He responded quickly to emails when I had a question.  Location, location, location!

15719599|A close place by the airport, but also a spectacular view of the Boston skyline! As the description says, you get what you pay for, and you're paying for location. The neighborhood has ample parking and is nice to go for a walk across the street to the park.  The apartment is kind of an older place with multiple rooms and the very basic necessities. Not the most beautiful places, but it gets the job done. It's one of those places I'd wear my flip-flops inside the house. Alexandr tries to make it accommodating with breakfast items, coffee, and any sundries you'll need. The place was just what we needed before heading to the airport in the morning. Be aware that you may be sharing the place with other travelers staying in the other rooms, but since everyone is busy coming and going, you may never see them.  Overall, valuable location with your basic needs covered.|Alexandr was an amazing host. Our flight was slightly delayed, but he still met us after midnight. We only stayed one night, but he held our bags most of the next day and even let us shower the next day prior to leaving for the airport and a 9 hour flight. The space was as advertised and very basic. Our room had a ceiling fan but no AC. We were in Boston during a hot spell, so we left the widows open for a while. When sleeping though it was too loud so we had to close them up. Even so, the host was so amazing I have to give this 5 stars. |Alexandr is a really kind hoste. He was present during our arrival with my girlfriend, helping us to visit his housing. We had a quite room and shared bathroom and kitchen with three other people with who there was absolutely no problem. Some food was available in the kitchen which is a really nice attention from Alexandr. His house is useful because closed to the airport and to a subway station from which we can easily reach the dowton of Boston in few minutes. I highly recommand Alexandr !  Alexandr est un hte trs agrable. Il a t prsent durant notre arrive avec mon amie en nous aidant notamment  visiter les lieux. Nous avions une chambre calme et une salle de bain ainsi qu'une cuisine partage avec trois autres personnes avec qui nous n'avons eu aucun problme. De la nourriture tait disponible dans la cuisine ce qui est une attention toute particulire de la part d'Alexandr. Sa maison est trs pratique car proche de l'aroport mais aussi d'une station de mtro depuis laquelle on arrive en centre-ville de Boston rapidement. Je recommande vivement Alexandr !|Alexandr was such a great host! Very welcoming and he gave us a quick introduction to the place and reminded us many times that he would be available if we had any questions. The location, although in East Boston, had pretty good access to downtown. There was also a large selection available for breakfast and the kitchen was very clean. Thank you!|The front of the apartment is a very nice park and with the view of river and the city and it's beautiful. We had breakfast here and it's very relaxing. The apartment is very basic.

1692573|Cozy, comfortable 2-bedroom and kitchen apartment was just perfect for our week-long visit to JP. Its location close to shops, great coffee, and everything we needed were an added bonus. Street parking was challenging but not bad for JP. We will definitely try to stay here the next time we come to the area to visit our daughter. It truly felt like home. |Cosy, tastefully decorated, and spotlessly clean 2 BR on 3rd floor of Kelly's and Phil's house in a beautiful and quiet street in JP. Shared entrance and staircase. 5 min walk to JP center and public transportation. Unrestricted parking available.   We stayed with our two kids (5 and 6) for 2 weeks. They loved their room with lots of fantastic games and books.   The kitchen was suited for breakfast. For dinner we usually bought prepared meals from Whole Foods Market (5 min by car).   On warm days, the apartment warmed up quickly, when the aircondition was turned off.  The Arboretum and Jamaica Pond are in 5 min walking distance. The Zoo 5 min by car. Down Town 25 min by public transportation. |Kelly's place is lovely. Very clean and comfortable. The neighbourhood is great with nice restaurant and food options. A really nice place to come back to after a day of sightseeing - I would stay again next time I am in the area. |Phil and Kelly were very warm and friendly. The made sure to leave a way for me to get in even though they weren't around and they were very easy to get in contact with.  The place was very clean and looked even better than the pictures. Also I loved the design!  My only qualm was that this is listed as an Entire Place and I feel as though it should be listed as a Private Room. While I did have the whole 3rd floor to myself, with my own private bathroom, kitchenette, and bedroom(s), I did have to pass through the main entrance to get there. In the evenings I could sometimes hear the family downstairs, who were by no means loud or obnoxious, but it just made my stay feel a little less private.  Otherwise, it's a lovely place to stay. Walking distance to some really nice restaurants, to Jamaica Pond, and to the MBTA bus.|Kelly's place definitely ranks as one of my favorite Airbnb experiences. The pictures don't do it enough justice! Beautiful space, tons of room, very clean, and located in a great part of town. I loved being in a historical home that felt like a more local experience. I would stay here again for sure. |Urban oasis trendy JP 'hood - suite|Jamaica Plain|Entire home/apt|https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/75644887/4c963a78_original.jpg?aki_policy=large|https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1692573

11498416|Exactly what we needed. Simple, super easy check in, located two blocks from the T, plenty of parking, and private. Simple accommodation, room was large with a comfy clean bed and fresh sheets. This is located in an older apartment building with each room being rented out by the night. Shared common areas are kitchen and bathrooms. |Great location. Very clean. |We passed a very great stay in this room in Boston. We was very happy and Ricardo is a very good  host. He is really present even if the system is different.   |The place isn't that central but I wouldn't let that put you off as it is only one stop on the subway to downtown Boston (which is a two minute walk from Ricardo's place). Ricardo is really helpful and was kind enough to let us leave our bags at his place after checkout. All rooms were very clean, only issue is there is no air conditioning in the bedroom which made life a bit uncomfortable in such hot weather. |Thank you for the room.

3432438|I booked this for a friend and his 23 yr old son. It worked fine for them. We were warned about the nightclub noise and it was more the thumping beat than anything but as I said, Stephanie gave us a heads up and earplugs.  There is a climb of about 16 steps up to place. High ceilings and artsy. Bed had some issues but once brought to attention it was addressed. Sofawas actually more comfortable just sleeping on top rather than pulling it out. Great location. A guide with info regarding what to do with sheets and towels in the unit would be a help because we don't always look at the online info. Nice tv and Apple TV hookup. A toaster would be nice. Microwave was a good help. |Great location. Awesome place!|Great place.

Accommodations are sparse; poor lighting, mildewed shower and sofa bed not for sleeping.|Hermina's place was a great base campe for our weekend in Boston. Easy access to Red Line. We had the big room in the basement. Though the bathroom was shared, we never had any issues our contention with its use. Thanks, Hermina! :)|The house interior is beautiful and the king size bed plus beautiful walk in shower was a plus. Right next to the police station I felt safe and I loved the free parking on street. Hermina was very pleasant and I would definitely use her services again. |The room was very nice, clean, spacious and quiet. We had the basement for us. Even if Hermina wasn't there during our stay, we had someone we could contact for questions or emergencies by SMS. We had fresh bedsheets and towels when we arrived and access to Wifi, the kitchen,  a washing machine and  a dryer. The house is very close to a metro station. The neighborhood is a little disavantaged but we felt safe since the house is close to a  police station. If you don't like touristic areas, it's a good way to get to know another dimension of Boston.

8662258|Amanda was an incredibly hospitable and generous host. The check-in process was very well-organised and Amanda made sure I had everything needed.  The apartment matched the online description. It was clean and tidy and the foldout sofa bed had privacy from the panel screens. The apartment is centrally located in the historic neighbourhood of Beacon Hill and within a very short distance of Boston Common.  I would recommend this AirBnB apartment to friends.  |Amanda was great - very accommodating!|Amanda is a very kind and thoughtful host.  The location is awesome.

414419|Everything was great.|The photos you see online - and the description - are accurate. And there is no denying the location, or Ravi's excellent communication; he's very easy to work with. The issue is what you don't see - and what is not said. The bathroom that shares a sink with the kitchen really means there is only one sink - in the kitchen. Even that isn't such a big deal, until you see the kitchen floor that's not in the pictures - missing linoleum, some parts with holes where it's just missing. It didn't feel clean at all. Then there's the bathroom; the size wasn't an issue, but the condition was. The shower has layers of old, dirty, moldy caulking - I didn't shower for 2.5 days as a result. The toilet appears to be sinking into the floor, and is very wobbly. Finally, the electric is scary; how it passes code is beyond me. I had such high hopes based on the other recommendations of this place, and they were quickly dashed. In hindsight we should have paid the rates that were double this.|Ravi made us feel very welcome and trusted. Perfect host.|We loved staying in the apartment! The location was perfect and the apartment was very clean. Ravi was a great host. He was very accommodating and met us late at night to hand off the keys after our flight was delayed. Overall a great experience and would absolutely recommend this apartment. Can't beat the price at this location! |Ravi was very prompt and responsive! Eclectic and artsy place in a great area!

3068453|Ahmed's appartment is REALLY well located, very nicely decorated and the bed is comfortable. Unfortunately, we were really disapointed by its cleanliness. The walls, the couch and the kitchen sink were dirty and the shower curtains were really disgusting. I know this is an old building but I am able to distinguish the old from the dirty and poorly maintained. I'm sorry to have to write this but the cleanliness is an important factor for me. There is also a constant pizza and frying smell coming from the restaurant underneath, which can be a little annoying in the morning... Fortunately, the bed and the towels were clean and we only needed the appartment to sleep and take showers. Eddie (Ahmed's assistant) was nice and helpful. We had a nice time in Boston anyway and this appartment made us save money compared to a hotel room, but I think more attention should be given on the cleaning.|The host was proactive and quick in responding to my inquiry, answering questions, setting up time to pick up key.

Comfortable bed and nice linens, large private bathroom. We loved walking everywhere. |Even though I was there 24 hours, Afeng made me feel at home. The room and private bath were clean and comfy. I really enjoyed chatting with her daughter - a nice young lady!|It was perfect |My boyfriend and I felt so welcome staying with James and Afeng. James helped us to find a parking space, Afeng left us a pitcher of lemon water in our room, and they introduced us to both of their children. They were very friendly and kind. The room itself had a comfortable bed for two, and James and Afeng respected our privacy while we were in the room. James and Afeng responded to our request almost instantly and on very short notice. We were looking for a place to stay that night, and they agreed that we could arrive at 10pm (a mere 3 hours after we contacted them).|James and Afeng were the kindest and most accommodating hosts one could ask for. Their home is absolutely wonderful and in an ideal location right net to the T in a beautiful neighborhood. Parking is also very convenient!

The location was convenient, and made it very easy for them to navigate around the city. The management was also very communicative and super easy. I will definitely look to book here again in the future. Thanks Dave!|Great first airbnb experience. Super clean and convenient to everything. Will stay again|This is a wonderful apartment in a perfect location. My wife and I stayed with our three kids ages 7-12. The apartment was very clean and roomy. The check-in was handled by a professional company and everything was easy. The location is excellent - we were within easy walking distance of everything. We had a great stay and we would definitely recommend it.|Terrific location. Well appointed. Easy to communicate with Dave and the concierge.|Great location!

5709298|The apartment had a great location.  Jay was very accommodating and helpful.|We had a wonderful stay! The perfect location and easily accessible to all of Boston! Jay was very responsive all all questions before and during our stay.  |Amenities were very comfortable and clean. Neighborhood was quiet and lots of dining options.   The only downside was the lack of public parking in the Area, but it seems to be the same way all over Boston. I recommend travelers to find a Parking garage (44-4824h) and use Uber to get to other neighborhoods.     |Jay was very responsive and the place was great!

The amenities and location were perfect. It's centrally located to almost everything. Couldn't have asked for a better experience. We will definitely book again.|El departamento esta muy bien ubicado. Es amplio y sueper comodo. Mi unica contra fue los 4 pisos por escalera que no sabia porque no lei bien la descripcin. Pero Jay muy bien predispuesto intento de ayudarnos a solucionarlo. Pero finalmente nos quedamos ahi y no estuvo nada mal un poco de ejercicio|Really nice place to stay with a good view. Bring your walking shoes and earplugs if you are a light sleeper. The street noise was noticeable at night but after walking all day it wasn't really a problem. Jay is really easy to work with and very easy to get ahold of. We would stay here again due to its central location. |Place was perfect. Incredible location.
